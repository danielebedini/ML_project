# Machine Learning project
Exam project for the university course of Machine Learning from the Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence. Prof. Alessio Micheli.

### Important!
Before executing the code, read carefully the file "requirements.txt". We used the most famous libraries such as NumPy and MatPlotLib, but for the right version we reccomend to check the requirements file.

### How to execute the model
For saving space, we did not include the dataset that we used. If you want to use a specific dataset, you can add them in the folder "data/monk" or "data/cup" and then execute the selected model.

Once you have selected the model and the dataset, you can runthe following commands:
'''
python [folder of the model]/model.py
'''
